# Diner-Waitlist-Website

A basic waitlist website for a korean barbeque diner. env file containing database url/secret ommitted for obvious reasons. Store owner password is 'h'.

Tech stack includes: ejs, node, mongoDB, html and css.

#The website is hosted here

Feel free to mess around with it. As it is hosted on a free platform the website tends to be laggy. Store owners are allowed to see number of minutes waiting as well as remove 
people from the queue.
